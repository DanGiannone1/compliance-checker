## 1. Introduction

This Statement of Work ("SOW") is entered into between TechNova Solutions, Inc. ("Service Provider") and Meridian Healthcare Systems ("Client") pursuant to the Master Services Agreement dated January 15, 2025 ("Agreement"). This SOW describes the professional services to be provided by Service Provider to Client.

### 1.1 Project Overview

This project involves the implementation and integration of a new Electronic Health Records (EHR) system to replace the Client's legacy system. The implementation will include data migration from the existing platform, customization of the new EHR system to meet Client's specific workflows, integration with third-party applications, comprehensive user training, and post-implementation support. This project is critical for improving operational efficiency, enhancing patient care coordination, and ensuring compliance with current healthcare regulations.
