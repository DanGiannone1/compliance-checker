# PRE-ASSEMBLY INTRODUCTION

Unless you are particularly adept at assembling flat-pack/knock-down furniture, we understand building ready-to-assemble furniture can be a frustrating experience for some. To help avoid confusion and to make the assembly process quicker and smoother, we have provided some helpful tips. Before you begin the assembly, please read the following:

1. Due to the size and/or weight on most of the ready-to-assemble furniture, it is highly recommended that the assembly should be done near the area of its intended location. Make sure you have enough space to move around during the assembly. ALWAYS have at least two people to help with transporting and assembling of the product to avoid any potential injury and/or damage.
2. To protect from damage, assemble the item on a clean, protective surface, such as on a carpet or cardboard.
3. Make sure you have taken all the parts and hardware out of their packaging. Do not throw away packaging material until assembly is completed.
4. Make sure all parts and hardware are accounted for by comparing the actual parts and hardware to the list provided in the assembly instructions. Also check for any irregularity such as crack, flaw or improperly drilled hole. If there is any problem or missing piece, please contact the manufacturer or the supplier. Please have the model number, part number and a brief description of the problem ready will help expedite the replacement process.
5. Read the entire instruction manual and view the diagrams first before assembling. Arrange your parts in order of use and group the identical hardware together to make it easier to grab each piece as you begin to assemble.
6. During the assembly process, make sure all parts are properly aligned before tightening with the tool provided or required for the assembly. Do not use power tools and do not over tighten.
7. When applying glue to the wood dowels to bond the parts together, please be ABSOLUTELY certain that the parts are correct and lined up with each other (refer to diagrams and take notice of the various pre-drilled hole locations). When in doubt, assemble the parts together first and if the parts fit right, then apply glue to the wood dowels.

1. Secure the threaded end of the cam bolt by using a screwdriver.

   Turn right (clockwise) to tighten.

   Align the cam connector with its side opening (or arrow) pointing to the small drilled hole.

# ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

**Assembling Drawer’s Runners (a.k.a. Rails, Glides, Slides or Guides)**
An assembly of ONE drawer requires two sets of runners. The runner is composed of an inner rail and outer slide. Please read completely first before assembling.

**Mounting the Inner Rail (Fixed) of the Runner:**
Before mounting, please determine which side of the panel is the front and rear. The single screw hole on the outer slide MUST be positioned on the FRONT of the panel. Place the inner rail of the runner in its correct position and flat on its back. Slide the outer slide out to the way to align the center or second holes on both ends of the inner rail with the pre-drilled holes on the panel. For most applications, the center or second holes are used but if not, just make sure the appropriate rail holes are aligned up with the panel holes. Use two screws to secure the inner rail of the runner onto the panel.

**Mounting the Outer Slide (Moveable) of the Runner:**
Each outer rail is secured with a single screw onto the FRONT SIDE of the drawer. Extend the two outer slides of the runners and place the drawer in between those two outer slides. Align the pre-drilled holes on each side of the drawer with the screw holes of the outer slides. Use two screws to secure from the inside of the drawer into the screw holes of the outer slides.

Extend the two outer slides of the runners so that they are align with the sides of the drawer. Make sure the pre-drilled holes from the drawer align with the screw holes of the outer slides. Secure two screws from the inside of the drawer using a Phillips screwdriver to tighten them to the outer slides.

Make sure the product is rested on a flat surface and does not feel loose or wobbly. If it does, double check that the bolts/screws are secured and properly tightened.
