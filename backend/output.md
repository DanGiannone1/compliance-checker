**Conventions Used Within This Report**


Clients must have a clear understanding of the terms used in this report. The following conventions have been used to highlight or
categorize issues encountered by the writer during the inspection _._

_**IMPORTANT:**_ An issue that doesn’t necessarily need repair or replacement, but, in your inspector’s opinion is a
**significant** issue that needs to be brought to the attention of the client. An example might be an appliance that is
functioning fine, but the inspector knows has been recalled by the manufacturer.

_**ATTENTION:**_ A less significant issue that doesn’t necessarily need repair or replacement, but needs to be
brought to the attention of the client. An example might be a poor-quality component in use that works fine but
could be improved upon. This may also include items that are routine maintenance items. An example might be
caulking the exterior of windows and doors every fall to ensure a weather tight seal.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ An issue that in the opinion of your inspector needs repair now. This is typically something
that is either damaged or a safety issue.

_**FURTHER INSPECTION:**_ An issue that in the opinion of your inspector needs an independent additional
inspection and evaluation by a trade professional.

_**DANGEROUS:**_ An issue, in the opinion of your inspector, that is inherently dangerous. This can include issues
that were not a violation of any code and weren’t considered a safety concern at the time of original construction,
because inspectors cannot “grandfather” issues that present a threat to life or safety, regardless of the age or
condition of a home. Clients must make their own decisions whether to accept an issue based on the age of a home
or because it was allowed at the time of original construction.

_**EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT:**_ Major, high-cost electro-mechanical or plumbing components that need
replacement now or in the near term.

**REPLACEMENT NEEDED:** Minor structural, electro-mechanical or plumbing components that need
replacement now.

**AREA OF CONCERN:** Issues that in the opinion of your inspector may soon develop into an issue needing
repair or replacement or the services of a trade professional.

**POORLY MAINTAINED:** Used to highlight components that in the opinion of your inspector have clearly not
had proper maintenance during expected service life.

**NEEDS SERVICING:** Used to highlight electro-mechanical components that in the opinion of your inspector
need to be serviced now by trade professionals.

Images used in this report are a representation of the conditions found on-site during the inspection and are included for reference
by the Client. Not every issue is illustrated with a photograph and not all items noted within a topic will be represented by
photographs. For example, a damaged window seal that is found present in multiple locations throughout the building may not
have photographs of each instance at each location.

This report is not a warranty and this firm does not warrant that this report will be accepted as written by all parties to the transaction.
Clients are cautioned that trade professionals will not always agree with these assessments. Some may see an issue as more serious
than described here, while others may consider an issue less serious or even non-existent. That is because these conventions are the
writer’s subjective assessment only, and are based on his or her own training and experiences. For that reason, this firm recommends
that clients always obtain estimates for repairs from their own contractor, not those chosen by a seller or a real estate agent, and be
sure to obtain a second opinion concerning all costs and proposed repairs.

**PURPOSE AND SCOPE**


_A home inspection is a non-invasive visual examination of a residential dwelling, performed for a fee, which is_
_designed to identify observed material defects within specific components of said dwelling. Components may include_
_any combination of mechanical, structural, electrical, plumbing, or other essential systems or portions of the home,_
_as identified and agreed to by the client and inspector, prior to or during the inspection process._

_A home inspection is intended to assist in evaluation of the overall condition of the dwelling. The inspection is based_
_on observation of the visible and apparent condition of the structure and its components on the date of the inspection_
_and not the determination of future conditions._

_A home inspection will not reveal every problem that exists or ever could exist, but only those material defects_
_observed on the day of the inspection._

_A Material defect is a problem with a residential real property or any portion of it that would have a significant_
_adverse impact on the value of the property or that involves an unreasonable risk to people on the property. The fact_
_that a structural element, system or subsystem is near, at or beyond the end of the normal useful life of such a structural_
_element, system or subsystem is not by itself a material defect._

_An Inspection report shall describe and identify in written format the inspected systems, structures, and components_
_of the dwelling and shall identify material defects observed. Inspection reports may contain recommendations_
_regarding conditions reported or recommendations for correction, monitoring or further evaluation by professionals._

**ROOF SYSTEM**


The condition of roof felt paper or membrane below the roof outer covering is unknown and cannot be inspected
without possible damage to the covering. Inspectors do not access the roof if roof is too high or steep or could be
damaged by accessing it. Antennas, solar systems, and other attachments are not inspected in the scope of this report.
No guarantee or warranty is made by this inspection as to whether the roof leaks at the time of the inspection or is
subject to future leaking.

The roofing inspection was conducted from the ground and adjacent surfaces. The roof is a pitched style. The building
has a gable style roof. The roofing materials are asphalt shingles. The roof appears to be in good condition. Only
routine maintenance is recommended. An asphalt shingle roof consists of organic asphalt shingles. An organic asphalt
shingle has an expected service life of at least 25+ years from the date of installation when properly installed and cared
for. Some grades and weights of shingles last longer, but without knowing the specific manufacturer and model of
shingle it is impossible to determine the actual expected service life within the scope of this inspection. This roof is 4
years old and is original to the home's construction.

The roof system flashings consist of aluminum and were found at the plumbing and vent collars and the roof to wall
intersections. The flashing is in good condition.

The building has aluminum gutters and downspouts. The downspouts all discharged directly onto grade at the base of
the foundation. This condition often results in water infiltration into basements or crawlspaces, as well as risking
damage to the foundation caused by settling, as the soil under the footings becomes saturated and more fluid. It is
recommended that all downspouts be modified or extended so they convey roof runoff to a point at least six feet from
the base of the foundation. This can be done with extensions and splashblocks, or via buried lengths of non-perforated
drainpipe that are connected to bubbler pots, sometimes known as pop-ups, that allow water to surface at the desired
distance from the foundation.

_**ATTENTION:**_ The roof cover is aging normally. Some typical indicators of aging (such as minor surface cracking
and slightly raised seams) were visible. However, the wear is consistent over the entire surface and typical for a cover
this age.

> Image: This image shows the exterior of a white house with black shutters, a sloped roof, and sunlight shining on the roof.




_**ATTENTION:**_ To ensure the longevity of your home, be sure to clean and maintain your gutter and downspout
system seasonally and the caulking at joints and seams should be inspected and touched up at two-year intervals.
Clogged downspouts can lead water infiltration into the home or even ice damming in the winter months. Leaf guards
are recommended once the trees within the yard mature. Small metal cages are also recommended to be installed
overtop the hole in the gutter where water drains into the downspout. This simple device can be found at any hardware
store and will prevent most debris and animals from entering the downspout creating potential blockages.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ Many of the downspouts around the home do not have extensions or splash blocks beneath
them to help divert water away from the foundation. This condition can cause soil erosion and can allow water to
infiltrate the foundation walls and enter the basement. It is recommended that downspout extensions or splash blocks
be installed at every downspout to ensure that water is diverted away from the foundation.

In areas of high traffic an underground extension can be installed that ends in a bubbler pot. The bubbler pot is a small
cylinder that sits at grade level so that a lawn mower can go over top of it with damage when it is not in use. When it
rains pressure from the water flowing down the downspout causes it to rise up above the ground and discharge water.

> Image: The image shows the side of a white house with black hoses on the ground, a small pile of rocks near the foundation, and a children's playset in the grassy yard.




_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ It is recommended that the downspout in the corner of the rear deck be secured to the building
to ensure it does not leak or fall off during a storm.

**EXTERIORS**


Landscaping and lot topography is examined during a residential house inspection as they can have a significant
impact on the building structure. It is important that surface runoff water is adequately diverted away from the
building, especially in areas that have expansive soil characteristics. Low spots or depressions in the topography can
result in ponding water that may exert hydrostatic pressure against the foundation. This pressure can cause a variety
of effects on the building. A high water table or excessive ground saturation can also impact septic systems. Even over
watering of gardens and shrubbery can have significant effects. A similar impact can result from tree roots growing
against the foundation and causing cracking or movement of the structure. It is a standard recommendation that the
lot grading slopes away from the building. Grading should fall a minimum of one inch every foot for a distance of six
feet around the perimeter of the building. It is also important that tree branches are not permitted to overhang the roof
and that all landscaping is kept well pruned and not permitted to grow up against any part of the building. This will
help prevent the development of pest and insect problems.

The exterior cladding consists of a combination of vinyl siding and stone veneer. The exterior wall surface is in good
overall condition with minor repairs needed. The exterior trim is a combination of composite and aluminum. The
exterior trim is in good overall condition. The exterior entry doors are a combination of vinyl sliding glass and metalclad with windows units. The entry doors are in good condition. The garage doors are metal, sectional rollup. The
doors are in good condition. The eaves consist of enclosed and vented vinyl soffit material. The eaves are in good
condition. There is an attached vinyl composite lumber sundeck located in the back of the residence. The sundeck is
in good condition. The sundeck has wooden support columns atop concrete and steel piers. The support columns are
in good condition. The railings are vinyl with vinyl balusters. The railings are in good condition. The home is built on
a basement and the foundation is reinforced concrete. The foundation is in good overall condition where visible.

The yard slopes away from the home on all sides but there is some negative grading under the rear deck.
The driveway is asphalt. The driveway is in fair condition. The walkways are concrete. The walkways are in good
condition.

Vinyl or aluminum siding materials are extremely popular because they require less periodic maintenance than other
types of siding materials. However, it is still necessary for a homeowner to conduct regular and proper periodic
maintenance of the exterior.

At least once a year, the client should carefully inspect the exterior walls, eaves, soffits or fascia for signs of damage
caused by machinery, weather, roof leaks, overfull gutters, trees or ice, and refasten or repair individual siding panels
as necessary. All J-channels around windows and doors should be carefully examined to ensure they are secure and
draining correctly. Finally, the siding should be cleaned following the manufacturer's instructions.

Brick veneer, faux stone or stucco are arguably the most attractive and certainly the most durable of exterior cladding
materials known to man. However, it is still necessary for a homeowner to conduct regular and proper periodic
inspection and maintenance of the exterior.

At least once a year, the client should carefully inspect the exterior walls for cracks, deterioration or staining caused
by machinery, weather, roof leaks, overfull gutters, trees or ice and have the cladding touched up or repaired by
appropriate contractors. Terminations around trim, doors and windows should be carefully examined to ensure the
cladding is weather-tight and weeps at the base of the walls should be kept free of soil and debris. Trim around doors
and windows should be examined, refastened, repaired, re-caulked and touched up where necessary.

PERIODIC MAINTENANCE: Even decks of composite lumber need periodic maintenance to keep them free of algae
that can make the surface very slick. I recommend cleaning composite decks annually by scrubbing with a mild
detergent and then rinsing with clear water.

_**IMPORTANT:**_ Some of the wooden columns for the rear deck are supported by steel bases but most are atop a
concrete pier. It is recommended that the drainage around the columns and under the deck be improved by minor regrading and adding gravel around them and under the deck. This will also help to reduce ponding and algae growth.
The columns were in good overall condition at the time of the inspection. Yearly monitoring is also recommended as
part of the home's routine maintenance schedule.

_**ATTENTION:**_ All exterior penetrations should be sealed using an elastomeric silicon based caulk for outdoor use.
It is recommended that this be checked annually and new caulk applied as needed. Copper wool can also be placed
within the hole from the interior of the residence to prevent rodents from chewing through the caulking and entering
the residence. This is typical of any home and should be part of a routine maintenance plan.

Please note, penetrations through the exterior of the building should not be sealed with expanding foam insulation.
This material is not intended to be exposed to UV light and will deteriorate.

_**ATTENTION:**_ Joints between dissimilar materials, such as stucco/stone to wood, stucco/stone to metal flashings,
stucco/stone to window and door frames, etc., should be sealed and caulked in order to prevent moisture infiltration
into the structure.

_**ATTENTION:**_ It is recommended that all doors, thresholds and windows be checked annually to ensure that the
caulking around them is in good condition and that no gaps or large cracks are evident. If any gaps or cracks are found,
they should be immediately repaired using an elastomeric caulk designed for exterior use. This will help ensure that
the building remains weather tight.

In stucco applications, this bead of caulking is very important to help maintain the system's ability to resist moisture
intrusion. There should be a bead of caulk at all openings.

_**ATTENTION:**_ It is recommended that the home owner install a "Charlie Bar" at any sliding glass doors as an extra
security measure. This type of device installs at the middle of the door, instead of the bottom and the purpose of this
device is to prevent someone from shimmying the door open. This device can be purchased at any quality home
improvement store and is fairly easy to install.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ The vinyl siding is loose to the right of the first floor sliding glass door. It is recommended
that the siding be secured to ensure it remains weather tight and does not blow away during high winds.

> Image: The image shows a section of a house exterior with white vinyl siding, a sliding glass door, a small wall vent, and a planter with red flowers on a wooden deck.




_**IMPORTANT:**_ The composite trim between the transom window and the first floor sliding glass doors is slightly
warped which has caused the top of the trim to project beyond the vinyl drainage channel of the window. It is
recommended that this area be monitored and caulked as needed to ensure moisture cannot flow behind the trim and
cause interior damage. Another option to consider would be to have a handyman temporarily remove this trim and
install an aluminum header flashing along the top edge to fully protect the trim and door below.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ The stringers for the deck stair and side entry stair are not properly supported from below.
By code, the stringers are supposed to either rest atop a wooden ledger board or have a metal shoe (like a joist hanger
to support them from below) installed to properly support and connect them to the landing joist. It is recommended
that each stringer receive the proper metal shoe for support.

> Image: The image shows the underside of a wooden deck structure with stairs, viewed from below, with a house and clear blue sky in the background.




_**ATTENTION:**_ There are various plants and or bushes next to the exterior wall(s). Recommendation: Trim or prune
all vegetation in such a way as to allow a minimum of six inches of clearance between the plant and the exterior wall.
This is necessary in order to prevent damage to the exterior and to inhibit the ability of insects to migrate into the
building structure.

It is recommended that the planting beds around the home be graded away from the home to allow for faster soil
drainage and that the amount of mulch in each bed be reduced to help stop water retention. These are conditions that
can allow some moisture to penetrate the foundation walls.

Whenever possible, it is recommended that decorative gravel be used in lieu of mulch for the first 12 inches of
landscaping near the building. This band of gravel will help the soil closest to the foundation drain faster, thus reducing
the potential for it to penetrate the foundation walls and enter the structure.

**ELECTRICAL SYSTEM**


A representative number of switches and receptacles that are readily accessible are tested for function. Determination
of adequacy of electrical panels and current capacity are not within the scope of this report. Low voltage systems,
stereos, intercoms, vacuum systems, security systems or other low voltage systems are not inspected and are not within
the scope of a home inspection.

Electrical service to the home is via underground service lateral. The service entry is in good overall condition. The
service entrance conductor is aluminum. The service entry conductor is in good overall condition. The electrical meter
is located on the side of the residence. The service grounding electrode conductor is a single-conductor copper ground
located on the driven ground rod at exterior of residence. The service ground conductor is in good condition. The main
disconnect is a 200 amp breaker type located inside the service entrance panel. The main service entrance panel is an
Eaton breaker system located in the basement. The panel is rated for 200 amps at 110/220 volts. The main service
panel is in good condition. The main service panel appears to have some room for future upgrades or additions to the
system.

The branch wiring is non-metallic sheathed cable (romex) type. It is copper wiring. The branch wiring is in good
overall condition where visible.

A representative number of fixtures, electrical outlets and switches were tested. A representative number of the
electrical receptacles in this home were tested and found to have the correct polarity and grounding.

Ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI) are installed in the all bathrooms, kitchen, exterior of the residence, garage,
laundry room and sump pump. GFCI are safety devices that sense a ground fault in an electrical system and cut power
to a circuit faster than one’s nervous system can react. Modern codes require any branch circuits at kitchen counters,
in bathrooms, basements, garages or exterior outlets to be GFCI protected. The code at the time this home was built
may not have required GFCI protection at these circuits. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend they be added at these
locations as an extra preventive safety measure.

Arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCI) are installed in the bedrooms, smoke alarm system, living room and dining room.
AFCI's involve a technology that detects arcing-faults in electrical circuits that could cause fires. By recognizing
characteristics unique to arcing and functioning to de-energize the circuit when an arc-fault is detected, AFCI's further
reduce the risk of fire beyond the scope of conventional fuses and circuit breakers.

Smoke alarms were found in the building. The Fire Code requires alarms in all hallways that lead to bedrooms and
within every bedroom. It is a standard recommendation that smoke alarms are located where they will not be triggered
by steam and/or fumes from bathrooms or kitchens. It is recommended that all alarms are hardwired into the electrical
system whenever possible.

Current Fire Code also requires the installation of a carbon monoxide detector in residences that utilize natural gas or
propane gas for cooking, hot water heaters, furnaces or other appliances.

_**ATTENTION:**_ ENERGY CONSERVATION TIP: It is recommended that all incandescent style light bulbs be
considered for replacement with CFL type fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs use considerably less energy, last 7-10
times longer than incandescent bulbs, and give off virtually no heat. Another energy saving option would be to use a
LED type bulb.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ It is recommended that the receptacle at the front entry porch and the rear deck be fully
secured to the wall to prevent damage to the wiring and to prevent the device from being pulled off of the wall during

use.

**HEATING AND COOLING**


The inspection of the heating system includes the coil, fan, mounting apparatus, shut off switch, thermostat wiring,
condensate evacuation, ducting and venting where visible. Inspection panels are only removed when accessible and
when sealing is not destroyed. Heating is not inspected during the summer months when the air conditioning is
normally in use. The system is operated (when outside temperature permits) and unless otherwise noted, all the above
was in acceptable condition at the time of the inspection.

Two natural gas forced air furnaces provides heat to the residence. The heating system is in fair overall condition, but
service is recommended for the attic unit.

The system has a PVC plastic vent that vents oout the side of the house and vents up through the roof. The flue is not
shared with the water heater. The last posted service date is unknown. The electrical safety switch for the heating
system is located at the top of the basement steps and in the hallway. The thermostat for the system is a digital type.
The heating system is natural gas fueled. The furnace was manufactured in 2019 and the A/C unit was manufactured
in 2019 according to the manufacturer's serial number.

The interior gas shut-off valve is located at the branch gas line to the furnace/boiler. The gas meter is located in the
same area as the electrical meter. The gas line plumbing is black steel and yellow flexible stainless steel tubing
"Gastite". The exterior gas shut-off valve is located at the meter.

The disconnect switch for the compressor is mounted within 50ft. and in sight of the unit. The air handler and
evaporator are attached to the furnace. The outside coil/compressor unit for the HVAC system is located at the side of
the home.

The ductwork for the heating system consists of flexible, insulated, polyethylene and galvanized sheet metal ducts.
The ducting is in good overall condition where visible. The main filter(s) for this system can be found at the intake
side of the air handler. This filter is a reusable cartridge type measuring 16" X 25" X 1".

The normal sequence of operating modes was executed with no obvious defects noted.

_**ATTENTION:**_ All rooms were checked for a heat/cooling source (delivery register) with no defects noted. All
rooms were conditioned at the time of the inspection.

_**IMPORTANT:**_ Heating and air conditioning system(s) last longer and perform more efficiently when serviced
seasonally. It is recommended that the HVAC system for this residence be serviced, cleaned and certified prior to
settlement. When the unit is serviced by a certified technician, they will identify any potential issues with the system
that are beyond the scope of a home inspection.

Please note, even if a system is functioning on the day of the inspection, there is no guarantee that it will continue to
work the next day. Therefore it is always recommended that one consider purchasing a home appliance warranty for
at least one year to help cover any surprise costs that may arise.

> Image: The image shows an open furnace unit in a basement or utility room, with exposed wiring and components, surrounded by construction materials and supplies.



> Image: The image shows an open furnace unit installed in an attic, with its front panel removed and internal components exposed.




_**ATTENTION:**_ Filters should be changed on a regular basis to ensure the HVAC system is running optimally. The
longer a filter is installed in the system, the more debris it collects which causes the filter to clog up. This will then
lessen the amount of air able to flow through the filter, causing the HVAC system to work harder to achieve the same
results as when a new fresh filter is installed. The standard fiberglass filters should be changed out every 3-4 weeks
while the pleated paper filters should be changed out every 8-10 weeks on average. If pets are living in the house, the
filters should be changed more frequently to help prevent them from clogging up. Larger 4" or 5" filters should be
changed every 4-6 months.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ There were water stains and rust stains noted within the attic furnace and/or on the housing
that indicate that the condensate line leaked at some point in the past and there was active condensate along the top of
the unit during the inspection. It is recommended that the unit be serviced and cleaned to ensure all drains are
functioning properly. Repair as needed.

_**ATTENTION:**_ The ductwork in the attic is hung from the structure with strapping which is typical of this type of
installation. This strapping can crush the duct closed over time as the flexible duct material settles. It is recommended
that the ductwork in the attic be checked every year to monitor settlement that could cause the ducts to pinch closed.
If they are starting to close, then move the straps or add additional straps to eliminate the pinch points.

**PLUMBING SYSTEM**


When reference is made to the type of plumbing, the comment relies on a visual observation, seller statements, the
presence or absence of a water bond, and what may be present in the way of notification in the electrical service panel.
There is no non-invasive way to determine what is behind a closed wall. For example, when copper plumbing is
identified, copper piping protrudes from the walls behind plumbing fixtures. If client requires absolute knowledge as
to the type of plumbing throughout the home, then a consultation with a licensed plumbing contractor is recommended.

Inspectors are not required to determine the source of the water supply or operate any valve except water closet flush
valves, fixture faucets, and hose bibs. Solar systems, septic systems, wells, filters, conditioners, yard watering systems
and fire sprinkler systems are not part of this inspection.

Water stop valves and overflows are not checked for function in the course of a home inspection. Fixtures and trim
are observed for function only and not for cosmetic value.

The plumbing system is connected to a municipal supply and waste system. The service pipe to the house is 3/4-inch
copper pipe.

Interior distribution piping is 1/2-inch cross-linked polyethylene(PEX) pipe. The branch piping is in good overall
condition where visible with no active leaks noted during the inspection while the fixtures were running. The fixtures
and faucets are in good condition. The piping supports are in good condition. Each fixture was tested for proper water
flow and rate. Each was found to be acceptable. The functional drainage was tested and was found to be acceptable.

The drain/waste plumbing is schedule 40 ABS plastic pipe. The waste piping is in good overall condition where visible
with no leaks noted during the inspection after testing all fixtures. Vent plumbing is schedule 40 ABS plastic pipe.
The vent piping is in good overall condition where visible.

Hot water for the residence is provided by a conventional storage tank with 40 gallons of capacity. The energy source
for the water heater is natural gas. The water heater was manufactured in 2019.
MAKE: American

MODEL: PVG6250S40NVS200

SERIAL: 1902113246913

The water heater is located in the basement. The water heater exhausts out the side of the house via a direct vent. The
fuel shut-off valve is located on the fuel line. The water heater automatic safety control is in good condition. The water
heater is in good condition.

A sump pump has been installed to augment drainage. The pump is equipped with an anti-backflow device and appears
to be properly plumbed and wired. I checked to ensure that the system is operational by lifting the float and noted that
the pump came on. Though the device appears to be installed correctly and came on when tested, I did not test the
system by flooding it so I can't say how much water it is capable of pumping within a given time frame or guaranty it
will work when needed.

The main water entry shutoff is located in the basement. The main waste clean-out is located in the basement.

_**ATTENTION:**_ ENERGY CONSERVATION TIP: In order to help conserve energy, it is recommended that the
holes/penetrations, through cabinet bottoms and walls, where plumbing pipes run through be sealed using either spray
foam insulation or silicon caulking. This will prevent conditioned air from flowing down into the basement and vice
versa and will help your HVAC run more efficiently.

_**ATTENTION:**_ The gas lines have been bonded/grounded properly.

Do not remove the grounding wire (single aluminum wire) from the pipe as this will allow the gas line to be more
susceptible to static charge or an electrical spark.

_**ATTENTION:**_ This is the main service shut-off and supply line for the residence is located in the basement, near
the front of the wall. Shut-off valves located here will turn the water off for the entire residence. The meter is located
in a vault in the front yard.

_**REPAIR NEEDED:**_ The diverter spout at the tub/shower in the second floor hall bath leaks or will not function
properly and needs to be repaired or replaced.

> Image: The image shows a bathtub with a shower curtain partially drawn, featuring a modern faucet and handle against tiled walls.




_**ATTENTION:**_ ENERGY CONSERVATION TIP: It is recommended that all water supply pipes be covered with
pipe insulation to increase the efficiency of the water heater and to prevent condensation from forming on the cold
water lines.

_**ATTENTION:**_ This home has frost proof hose bibs for gardening or washing the car. This type of bib is less prone
to freezing in the winter months however some steps should be taken each winter to help ensure they do not freeze of
leak. Prior to winter, the water should be shut off to each bib and all hoses removed from the exterior spigot. The
spigot should also be left in the open/on position once the water has been turned off to allow the bib to drain and to
allow any moisture that may condense inside the pipe a way to expand if it should freeze in the winter months.

**INTERIORS**


The condition of floor covering under furnishings and appliances is unknown and outside the scope of the inspection.
Rooms or garages where floors or walls cannot be observed because of furnishings or stored items are similarly
excluded from the scope of the inspection.

Settlement of floors, walls, and ceilings is generally only noted when the settlement is of significant structural
importance where as the structure is compromised or soon will be. Typical settlement due to age is generally not noted
within the scope of this report.

The heat source for the room is a forced air furnace vent. The interior wall and ceiling surfaces are conventional
drywall. The wall surface is in good overall condition throughout the residence. The ceiling is in good overall condition
throughout the residence. The primary floor coverings are carpet, ceramic tile and engineered wood flooring. The
flooring is in good overall condition. The bathroom flooring is ceramic tile. The bathroom flooring is in fair overall
condition. The kitchen flooring material is engineered wood flooring. The kitchen flooring is in good overall condition.
The stairways and steps are in good condition. The railings are in good condition.

The kitchen countertops are granite. The kitchen countertops are in good condition. The kitchen cabinets are laminate
face frame with laminate/melamine shell. The kitchen cabinets are in fair overall condition. The bathroom countertops
are granite. The bathroom cabinets are laminate face frame with laminate/melamine shell.

Most interior doors are masonite. The interior doors are in fair overall condition. The windows are vinyl sash tilt wash
feature and single hung units. The windows are in good overall condition with some adjustment needed. The garage
doors are metal, sectional rollup style units. The garage doors are in good condition. The overhead garage doors are
opened and closed with an automatic door opener mechanism. The pedestrian door between the garage and the house
is fire rated and weather-stripped but the self-closing hinges have not been activated. It is required that the hinges be
activated to allow the door to close in an emergency and maintain the fire rating of the wall. The fire separation wall
and ceilings between the garage the house are in good condition.

_**ATTENTION:**_ Ceramic tile and vinyl floors should be caulked to bathtubs, toilets, cabinets, baseboards, etc., for
moisture protection. A material called grout caulk is available for ceramic tile installations that combines the standard
cement grout found in tile joints and a silicone based caulk to add flexibility. This type of caulk comes in many
different colors to match most existing grouts.

Resilient floor covering should be neatly sealed with caulk at the perimeter in baths and laundry rooms to ensure water
can't get under the surface, cause the adhesive to fail and the floor to peel.

Tile and laminate backsplashes should also be caulked to ensure a water tight seal.

Bathroom plumbing fixtures such as top mounted sinks and toilets should be caulked around the rim on a regular basis
to ensure water cannot seep beneath the fixture and damage the counter top or structure.

This is a routine maintenance item that should be performed on a yearly basis.

**BASEMENT AND CRAWLSPACE**


The foundation and structural section describes the basic characteristics of the house including the basement and
crawlspace areas. Some observations of certain areas of the structure, such as attic conditions, have been documented
elsewhere in this report so it is important that the client read the entire report, in order to have the best understanding
of this home current condition.

The inspection of the structure and foundation is limited to areas that are unfinished and within view at the time of the
inspection. We are not allowed to place a hole in the wall to look at the foundation if the basement is finished.

Vermin and other pests are part of the natural habitat, but they often invade homes. Rats and mice have collapsible rib
cages and can squeeze through even the tiniest crevices. And it is not uncommon for them to establish colonies within
crawlspaces, attics, closets, and even the space inside walls, where they can breed and become a health-hazard.
Therefore, it would be prudent to have an exterminator evaluate the residence to ensure that it is rodent-proof, and to
periodically monitor those areas that are not readily accessible. If evidence of rodents is found during the inspection,
it will be noted.

The building has a partially finished basement.

The home is built on a basement and the foundation is reinforced concrete. The foundation is in good overall condition
where visible. The basement is equipped with a drainage system and sump pump that were functional during the
inspection. The basement was dry at the time of the inspection.
The floor structure consists of platform framing with 2"x12" TJI joists on 16" centers sheathed with oriented strand
board (OSB). The floor is in good condition.

The wall insulation is fiberglass batt for an approximate R value of 13+ and has a vapor retarder of polyethylene
plastic. The insulation is in good condition.

_**ATTENTION:**_ It is recommended that a dehumidifier be installed within the basement area. This will help prevent
mold growth by reducing the humidity and by drying the space should minor moisture infiltration occur through the
foundation walls during times of heavy rains. The unit should be programmable and set to run between 40%-45%.
The unit should also be allowed to drain directly into a utility sink or a condensate pump so that it can run continuously
without the need to empty a bucket. The basement was dry at the time of the inspection.

**ATTIC AREA AND ROOF FRAMING**


The inspection of the insulation, vapor retarders and ventilation systems of this home was limited to only unfinished,
accessible areas that are exposed to view. No invasive inspection methods were used, therefore the presence of
required vapor retarders or the type and density of insulation installed behind finished surfaces could not be verified.
Even if the type of materials used could be determined, no declarations have been made here as to the installed density
or adequacy of concealed materials.

Should the client(s) wish detailed information concerning the existence/condition of any vapor retarders and insulation
concealed in the walls, ceiling cavities or other inaccessible and/or unviewable areas, I suggest consulting an insulation
contractor or certified energy auditor. Many have thermal imaging equipment that can aid in determining the overall
effectiveness of installed insulation systems and identify areas needing improvement.

The building has one attic space. Access is gained through a ceiling hatch in the main hallway. The attic was inspected
using a flashlight. The roof is a manufactured truss assembly. The truss chords are 2"x4" on 16" centers sheathed with
oriented strand board (OSB). The roof structure and sheathing is in good overall condition with no signs of active
leaks during the inspection. The building has an oriented strand board (OSB) floor in the attic. The floor cannot be
used for storage.

> Image: The image shows an attic with wooden framing, black HVAC ductwork, and a layer of white insulation on the floor.



> Image: The image shows an attic space with exposed wooden framing, insulated air ducts, and loose-fill insulation on the floor.




The attic floor insulation is blown-in fiberglass for an approximate R value of 38-49. The attic floor insulation is in
good condition. This roof/attic configuration uses passive ventilation utilizing under-eave intake vents consisting of
holes cut in the soffit that are either screened with mesh or covered with louvered material. There are ridge vents used
along the ridge of this attic/roof assembly to exhaust air. Like other types of vents, these enable air entering the
roof/attic near the eaves to rise through convection toward the ridge and then leave the roof envelope. Since ridge
vents are continuous, they provide more efficient movement of air out of the roof system than gable, roof or slot vents.

**1. Definitions and Scope**

1.1. A Home inspection is a non-invasive visual examination of a residential dwelling, performed
for a fee, which is designed to identify observed material defects within specific components of
said dwelling. Components may include any combination of mechanical, structural, electrical,
plumbing, or other essential systems or portions of the home, as identified and agreed to by the
Client and Inspector, prior to or during the inspection process.

I. A home inspection is intended to assist in evaluation of the overall condition of the dwelling.
The inspection is based on observation of the visible and apparent condition of the structure and
its components on the date of the inspection and not the determination of future conditions.

II. A home inspection will not reveal every problem that exists or ever could exist, but only those
material defects observed on the day of the inspection.

1.2. A Material defect is a problem with a residential real property or any portion of it that would
have a significant adverse impact on the value of the property or that involves an unreasonable
risk to people on the property. The fact that a structural element, system or subsystem is near,
at or beyond the end of the normal useful life of such a structural element, system or subsystem
is not by itself a material defect.

1.3. An Inspection report shall describe and identify in written format the inspected systems,
structures, and components of the dwelling and shall identify material defects observed.
Inspection reports may contain recommendations regarding conditions reported or
recommendations for correction, monitoring or further evaluation by professionals.
