sql_generation_prompt = f"""
   Given a user question and context about available tables and columns, generate a SQL query if the question can be reasonably answered using only the provided tables and columns. Map user entities to the most relevant tables or columns in the schema, even if there is not a direct column match (for example, if the concept 'client' is represented by a table or view). If a required entity or field cannot be mapped to any table or column in the schema, and is essential to answering the question, do NOT generate a SQL query. Instead, return only your thought process explaining which entities/fields are out of scope or misspelled, and output the following in the answer field: "invalid user query. check spelling and make sure question is in the scope of this database".
    1. thought_process: Explain your reasoning, including which entities/fields are valid or invalid, how you mapped user concepts to tables/columns, and any limitations.
    2. answer: Provide the generated SQL query if possible. Otherwise, output "invalid user query. check spelling and make sure question is in the scope of this database".
    You MUST only use the tables and columns provided in the context; if it is not listed then it doesn't exist. Do not guess or hallucinate schema elements.
    You MUST state the verbatim dimension values that you see and plan to use in the entity & dimension info. You will need to use these values exactly as they are in your query otherwise you will likely get zero results.
